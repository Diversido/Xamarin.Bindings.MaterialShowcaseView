# Xamarin.Bindings.MaterialShowcaseView
Xamarin bindings for MaterialShowcase android library

IMPORTANT: The sources for the bindings were a bit modified for our companies needs.

Nuget package:

https://www.nuget.org/packages/MaterialShowcase.Xamarin.Android/

For iOS you can use our version
https://github.com/Diversido/iOSMaterialShowcase.Xamarin
of original library interpretation by https://github.com/jonathanfontaine/iOSMaterialShowcase.Xamarin as a submodule

You can make changes in bindings or directly in the source (added as a submodule) and just use build.sh afterwards to get updated .dll and/or Nuget packages in _builds folder.
